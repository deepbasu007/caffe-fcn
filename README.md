# caffe-fcn for aerial imagery

This Caffe branch implements fully convolutional networks and Deconvolutional Networks for labeling of aerial imagery. 

This merges the following three branches of Caffe:

https://github.com/mitmul/caffe (For labeling of aerial imagery)

https://github.com/longjon/caffe/tree/future (For Fully Convolutional Networks with FCN-16 and FCN-8)

https://github.com/HyeonwooNoh/caffe (For the implementation of Deconvolutional Networks)

For the use of FCN and Deconvnet models for the labeling of aerial imagery, refer to the following code:
